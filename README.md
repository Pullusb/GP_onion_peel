**[Download latest](https://github.com/Pullusb/GP_onion_peel/archive/main.zip)**

<!-- ### [Demo Youtube]() -->

---  

## Description

Generate onion skin as individual `.peel` objects in a `.onion_peels` subcollection.
Those objects are used as onion skinning and can be manipulated to check objects
### Where ?

`Sidebar` > `Gpencil` Tab > `Onion Peel` Panel

---

<!--
## TODO:

- entering edit mode should hide collection (else all objects are visible at once)
- place peels slightly behind from camera (and from viewport ?)
- refresh choices:
    - Add choice to refresh all object or only current
    - Choose if other objects Onion are to be masked
- Apply matrix from evaluated object keys
- Custom placement peel feature (outapeg)

Bonus:
- Filter by key type (EZ... I think)
- Create direct frame offset mode and show option in view
